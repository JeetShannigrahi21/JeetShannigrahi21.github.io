# Academic Portfolio Website (GitHub Pages)

This is a minimalist academic site for **Jeet Shannigrahi**, built as a plain HTML/CSS/JS site compatible with GitHub Pages.

## Quick Deploy (User Site)

1. Create a repository named **`YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`** on GitHub.
2. Upload the contents of this folder (the `index.html`, `assets/` etc.) to the **root** of that repository and commit.
3. Open **Settings ▸ Pages** and under **Build and deployment** set:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main`  •  **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Visit **https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io**

> Docs: Quickstart and configuring a publishing source are linked below.

## Project Site (optional)

If you prefer a project site (e.g., `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/portfolio/`):
- Create a normal repository (any name), upload the files, then set Pages to deploy from `main` / root.
- Your site URL will be `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME/`.

## Visitor Counter

The old `hits.seeyoufarm.com` service is defunct. Use **hitscounter.dev** (or **hits.donaldzou.dev**).
- Go to https://hitscounter.dev or https://hits.donaldzou.dev
- Enter your final site URL (e.g., `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/`).
- Copy the generated `<img>` code and replace the placeholder badge in `index.html` (search for “Visitor counter” comment).

## Customize

- Replace `assets/images/profile.jpg` with your own photo.
- Edit text in `index.html` to update sections; tweak look in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Add new pages or sections by copying the structure.
